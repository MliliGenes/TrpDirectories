When you create an object, it acquires a resource. When the object is destroyed, it automatically releases that resource.

Early return from a function? Leak again. RAII eliminates entire categories of bugs by making cleanup automatic and deterministic. It's the reason C++ developers can write complex systems without garbage collection while maintaining memory safety. Languages like Rust have adopted and extended this concept as a core principle.",

The coroutine frame keeps them alive across suspensions, but destruction order might surprise you. Use unique_ptr for resources in coroutines to make lifetime explicit. Understand that co_await suspends the function but RAII objects stay alive until the coroutine completes or is destroyed."
